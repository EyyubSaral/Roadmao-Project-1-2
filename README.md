https://roadmap.sh/projects/cookie-consent

I got the main part of the website from the internet.

First, I built a div container and added one paragraph and two buttons for the pop-up, then styled them.
After that, I created two functions: one for the accept button and the other for the reject button. If accepted, the cookie would be stored.
Finally, I added a check so that if a cookie already exists, the pop-up should be hidden.
